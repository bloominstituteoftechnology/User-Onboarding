# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- this is the Readme from the cypress project -->

<!-- This project is a continuation of the work you have done previously.
- [ ] CD into your old project
- [ ] Continue to make changes and push to the same branch
- [ ] Install Cypress with npm.
      `npm install cypress --save-dev`
- [ ] run `npx cypress open`, After a moment, the Cypress Test Runner will launch.
- [ ]  Locate the integration folder at cypress/integration in your code editor
- [ ]  Create a form_test.js file.
- [ ]  Watch the Cypress Test Runner update the list of specs.

- [ ] Launch Cypress in interactive mode.
      
*Note:* 
You will see an error that says "No tests found in your file:" with your particular file path. This is because we have not written any tests yet. Now you will start writing tests.

### Task 2a: Write and Run Tests (MVP)

In order to complete this challenge you will need to write and run the following tests. They do *not* need to pass, so long as the reasons they are failing is legitimate.

Set up tests that will...

- [ ]  Get the `Name` input and type a name in it.
- [ ]  Use an asser
tion to check if the text inputted contains the name you provided (Hint: use the .should assertion)
- [ ]  Get the `Email` input and type an email address in it
- [ ] Get the `password` input and type a password in it
- [ ]  Set up a test that will check to see if a user can check the terms of service box
- [ ] Check to see if a user can submit the form data
- [ ] Check for form validation if an input is left empty

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

If you have time, write and run different tests based on common issues you have encountered working on this code for the past few days.

## FAQs

**What if not all of my tests pass?**

*Depending on the quality of your code from previous lessons, your tests might not pass. That is quite alright! The purpose of this project is to design tests that point out errors. As such, you just need to be sure that the tests are failing because of issues with your web page code, not issues with your test code.*
